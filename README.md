# AGRO UP <img width="37" height="37" src="https://img.icons8.com/color/48/sprout.png" alt="sprout"/>
A web application designed to support farmer-community with Intelligent Machine Learning technologies, providing live crop recommendation and prediction system and price prediction. In addition to our data-driven features, we offer a dedicated news page that keeps you up to date with the latest developments, industry trends, and agricultural news. 

## ABSTRACT <img width="35" height="35" src="https://img.icons8.com/color/48/solve-problem.png" alt="solve-problem"/>
India, with its abundant food production, faces a critical question: Does it have an excessive number of individuals engaged in agriculture? The strain on land resources stems from policies that often relegate farmers to marginal farming. To address these challenges, India requires a new approach that embraces intelligent technologies in agriculture, paving the way for "Precision Agriculture."    

With the help of AGROUP we address the problems faced using Live crop prediction and recommendation for precise agricultural practices with a growing support community to help farmers with their day to day challenges and also socializing their success.

- Before the following steps make sure you have git, Anaconda or miniconda installed on your system
- Clone the complete project with git clone  or you can just download the code and unzip it
```
https://github.com/pratyksha-22/Project-.git
```
- Once the project is cloned, open anaconda prompt in the directory where the project was cloned and paste the following block
```
conda create -n nenv python=3.7.7
conda activate nenv
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- And finally run the project with
```
python app.py
```
Open the localhost url provided after running app.py and now you can use the project locally in your web browser.

## FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS <img width="31" height="31" src="https://img.icons8.com/color/48/bullish.png" alt="bullish"/>
- More data can be collected for the second model for better results. currently we have only tried machine learning techniques but in future we could train the   model and test it with deep learning as well
- Due to constraint of time , we were unable to deploy the website on web-hosting-platform .
- More features could be implemented using other tech stacks like IOT etc for models like irrigation system 
- Better website design and better model training could be done
